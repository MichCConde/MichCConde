**`Digital Craftsman (Developer/Multimedia Specialist/Creator)`**

I'm an indie full-stack developer building my version of the digital world one step at a time. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. I plan to establish my own startup agency called **`Nexmode Development`**

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Mich's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  Before I started my coding journey, for as long as I can remember, I already had a knack for technology. Growing up, I was exposed to computers, consoles, and other devices. The first video game that I can remember playing was Counter Strike. Well, technically first video game I remember WATCHING someone play since my brothers hogged the computers all day. But ever since then, I have already been fascinated with tech.
  The older I got, the more I got exposed to tech. Applications, more video games, and even robotics. I loved every subject that was related to technology, mainly because I loved solving puzzles. I didn't exactly have someone to guide me on what to study to pursue on this path. All I had was my friend telling me to take the course Computer Science with him. And I did.
  I'm currently a 3rd-year Computer Science student and for every project I built, and every step I have taken towards my journey right now is purely because of my own curiosity towards technology. I look forward to what I can do in the future.
